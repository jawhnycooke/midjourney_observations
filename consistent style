RELEVANT BACKGROUND:

  >> User can specify up to 10 images as references
  >> User can specify up to 4000 characters of text descriptions
  >> User can modify the following parameters: (1) chaos, (2) version, (3) style, (4) seed

CORE QUESTION: What is the most effective way to ensure a consistent style across images from multiple prompts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTANDING THE MODEL DYNAMICS:

Midjourney, Dall-e-2, etc. all use a series of image-text pairs, mostly derived from the LAION datasets. When you specify
a prompt for the model, it will go back through all of its image-text pair references and favor those images that contain
your specific keywords. The image reference feature works by providing heavier weighting to the specific images referenced, in combination with
your supplied text references. The model then aggregates features identified from your image references with features
found in the images associated with your text prompt to create a final composite image meeting your request. 

NOTE: you can control how much emphasis is given to your reference images vs. the text prompt using the --iw parameter.

IMPLICATIONS:

About the image weighting parameter...

    There are many image-text pairs in the LAION datasets potentially matching your prompt. In contrast, you can only specify 10 reference images. 
    As such, even when using a very small --iw, your reference images will significantly outweight any individual image matching the text
    prompt. 

About creating a consistent style across images...

    To create a consistent custom style across different images generated by the model, you can use a combination of specific terms and 
    style-related descriptors in your prompts. This will guide the model to generate images that share common visual elements while still 
    responding to the unique aspects of each prompt.

    Strategies to help you achieve a consistent style across multiple images:

        Define a set of consistent style-related terms or phrases: Create a list of terms that describe the visual elements, color schemes, 
        textures, or other stylistic features that you want to be present in all images. This list can serve as your "style basket."

        Incorporate style-related terms in every prompt: When crafting prompts for different images, make sure to include one or more style-related 
        terms from your "style basket." This will guide the model to generate images that consistently feature the desired style elements.

        Use a consistent sentence structure: Ensure that each prompt follows a similar sentence structure or pattern, which can help the model to 
        recognize the style-related terms and apply them consistently across different images.
    
    For example, let's say you want to create a series of images with a consistent "watercolor" style and a "pastel color palette." You can craft prompts like this:

        "Create a watercolor-style image with a pastel color palette, featuring a serene beach scene with palm trees and a hammock."
        "Generate a watercolor-style image with a pastel color palette, depicting a bustling city street with people walking and cars driving by."
        
        By consistently incorporating the desired style-related terms ("watercolor-style" and "pastel color palette") into each prompt, you can 
        encourage the model to generate images that share these common style elements.
