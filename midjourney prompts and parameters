#Overview of midjourney parameters and how to use them

Midjourney Basics:

  /remix to enable modifications when creating variants
  /fast to enable fast mode (15 hour/mo cap) and /relax to turn off

  Basic Prompt format: [Image reference 1...] [Description of image] --[Parameters]

    Example: https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/blt7e3873b9518a48ef/5005528.png LEGO minifigure head --quality 1

      NOTE: Reference images must come first, followed by description, followed by parameters; all objects separated by a space (" ")
      NOTE: Images must be direct links (i.e., .jpg, .png)
      NOTE: You can weight the prompt to more heavily favor the reference images vs. the text by adding --iw 0.5 (0.25 by default, increase to favor img)
      NOTE: A max of 10 reference images can be specified.
      
      
What can you change besides the description and reference images?

  (1) Style

     Style depends on the model version (v5, v4, or earlier) -- default current model v4 has (3) options: #personal descriptions below

      4a) Watercolor / painting
      4b) Cartoon / 2D animation
      4c) Photo-realistic (ish)

     Style value by default is 100, with a range of 0 - 1,000; the more stylized, the more it will attempt the image in the style you referenced. To set,
     append --stylize [###] to your prompt or --stylize [high, medium or low]

     Example: --s 350 or --s high

  (2) Seed
  
     Seed is the random starting point of the image (value 1 - 4294967295); change to get a different image set, keep the same to create similar
     
     Example: --seed 123145
     
  (3) Chaos & Quality
  
      Chaos refers to how varied the initial image set will be, while quality refers to the image output resolution
      
      Accepted values -- chaos: 0 - 100; quality: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1
      
      Example: --chaos 250 or --quality 1



Tips for writing good prompts:

  Advanced prompts provide both reference images and textual descriptions of the image and the desired image style. 
  
    Example: https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/blt7e3873b9518a48ef/5005528.png https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ltVFN0bSL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg 
    LEGO minifigures photorealistic style --style 4c --stylize 350 --seed 123145 --chaos 25 --quality 0.75
    
   Text prompts:
   
    In addition to specifying a single artist (i.e., "in the style of davinci"), you can also specify image or painting characteristics, such as:
    
      A castle in the style of Dave Filoni's Clone Wars with volumetric lighting
