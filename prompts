On the usage of the Usage of the :: seperator

    Using :: asks the model to consider the two prompts separately. It will then try to fuse those elements together into a single image. The best
    way I have found to use it is to separate your style basket from your image description
    
    For example:
     
        Deep in the forest there is a wagon with a village far off in the distance::Comic book style, dungeons and dragons theme, hatched lines
        
   >> It is effective to separate image descriptors if you want those elements "fused" together... for example, specifying 'canopy:: wagon in the forest'
        will result in greater emphasis on canopies

  More the come...
