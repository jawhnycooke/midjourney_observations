On the usage of the Usage of the :: seperator

    Using :: asks the model to consider the two prompts separately. It will then try to fuse those elements together into a single image. The best
    way I have found to use it is to separate your style basket from your image description
    
    For example:
     
        Deep in the forest there is a wagon with a village far off in the distance::Comic book style, dungeons and dragons theme, hatched lines
        
   
   >> I have found it is not effective to try to separate the image description by :: as you lose the ability to specify many potential relationships
      of the objects by doing this (i.e., spatial)
