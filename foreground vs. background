RELEVANT BACKGROUND:

Diffusion models don't work by copying images directly - rather, they identify features of the image associated
with the selected class label. These features can be explicit, such as a word or watermark, or they can be very 
subtle, such as a repetition of the texture pattern. Understanding what types of features the Midjourney backend
is evaluating can help you select better reference images and design better prompts. One particular features of
interest is the spatial placement of the subject (i.e., foreground or background, right or left, etc.)

CORE QUESTION: Does midjourney understand when you specify the foreground and background subjects?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT THINKING:

It doesn't appear so... see below test result indicating which subject should go in the foreground [Further testing needed]
vs. which subject goes in the background do not appear to effectively place the subject in the image.

Example:

  First prompt: illustration in the style of looking for group comic: : dungeons and dragons fantasy theme with intricate details: : 
  subject in the foreground is playful elf warlock with bunny rabbit to its right: : subject in the background is a large castle overlooking 
  a seaside village in the distance: : warm color palette --version 5 --quality 1 --chaos 15

  Second prompt: 
  
  First prompt: illustration in the style of looking for group comic: : dungeons and dragons fantasy theme with intricate details: : 
  subject in the background is playful elf warlock with bunny rabbit to its right: : subject in the foreground is a large castle overlooking 
  a seaside village in the distance: : warm color palette --version 5 --quality 1 --chaos 15

As seen from these image outputs, changing the prompt to specify which subject is in the foreground or background does not appear to have
any impact on the actual placement within the image. My working theory is that this is because the model does not effectively distinguish
the term foreground vs. background, as this is unlikely to be in the labeled image's description. As such, a more effective means of
achieving this would be to provide reference images that are spatially similar to your desired output - i.e., if you wish to have a 
character in the foreground and a city in the background, provide similar spatially-composed images to achieve the desired output
rather than attempting to do this via prompt. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPLICATIONS FOR WRITING GOOD PROMPTS:

  >> The model does not understand the terms "foreground" and "background" very well; consider providing reference images with specific
  subjects in the foreground and background to achieve this goal, rather than specifying it via text.
