            [Text Description]

            Telecommunications satellite orbiting the Earth in photorealistic fashion

            --v 5 â€”seed 456784 --chaos 100 --quality 0.75 --s 1000

            [Result]

            Version 1 selected after one attempt: https://shorturl.at/knBIM alternate version using --iw 0.9 found here: https://shorturl.at/przWZ

            [Observations]

            Input images featured cylindrical satellites, but did not imagine to that degree. Also would have thought changing the image weight would have 
            helped that, but resulting satellite appears quite similar.
