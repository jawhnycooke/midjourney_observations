RELEVANT BACKGROUND:

  Diffusion models don't work by copying images directly - rather, they identify features of the image associated
  with the selected class label. These features can be explicit, such as a word or watermark, or they can be very 
  subtle, such as a repetition of the texture pattern. Understanding what types of features the Midjourney backend
  is evaluating can help you select better reference images and design better prompts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORE QUESTION: What features does the Midjourney algorithm evaluate when you provide reference images?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY FEATURES:

  1) Color - color scheme of the reference image, including overall palette, relative brightness or darkness of
  different colors, and any patterns or textures in the image
  
  2) Shapes and Structure - size, proportions, and orientations of different objects, as well as any patterns or
  symetries
  
  3) Texture - smooth, rough, shiny, or matte textures
  
  4) Lighting and Shadow - direction and intensity of light, the way that shadows are cast by different objects
  
  5) Objects - objects, particularly any included in the 1000 class labels featured in LAION-400
  
  6) Spatial Relationships - arrangement or pattern of objects in the image
  
  7) Semantic Features - ??
  
  8) Artistic Style - brushstrokes, composition, visual effects
  
  9) Pose and Orientation - how objects are positioned
  
  10) Emotion and Mood - ??
  
  11) Depth and Perspective - distance between objects in the image and the overall sense of depth and dimensionality
  
  12) Contextual information - objects similar to those displayed
  
  13) Surface Material or Finishes - beyond just texture, specific object surfaces
  
  14) Artistic Composition - balance, symmetry, harmony of elements
  
  15) Mood or Tone - ??
