RELEVANT BACKGROUND:

When you input a query to Midjourney, it goes through a Transformer which matches that query to a series of word 'embeddings' developed from WordNet;
this turns your query into a vector (i.e., a sequence of numbers, think like DNA). As the neural net updates across layers trying to identify features,
attention mechanisms help it to identify key pieces of that sequence that are good at predicting the class label. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf

    For example, if the class label is "McDonalds", the portion of the image that contains the classic golden arches is going to stand out in that
    DNA strand of all images.

While your query is not directly specifying a class label for the model to condition on, it does provide a type of numberical input that guides the
shaping of the reference group. 

Breaking it down:

    (1) Your query gets broken down into piece parts called tokens
    (2) Tokens are mapped to WordNet (always WordNet)
       
       >>It's not really a taxonomy...  think more like cluster groupings, though its more contextually routed than that. Lots of manual mapping of
          word types, meanings, similarties

    (3) WordNet embeddings are mapped to images based on LAION (https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/)
    (4) Diffusion model process

        >>Will have to push separate post, but in this case you basically start with a field of noise (that's why your initial image is just a blob),
          then it updates the image based on the reference images selected from query (Reference Group comes from your WordNet embeddings comes from
          your Tokens comes from your query)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORE QUESTION: How can you manually force the model into considering specific attention mechanisms?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT THINKING:

Why not just directly specify WordNet embeddings? Not exactly a realistic approach, but if you can direct attention to certain reference groups
within the dataset, you can exert greater influence on the model output. 

Two leading theories on how to manually create attention mechanisms based on your prompt:

    (1) Word Order
    (2) Word Count

Investigating if this is in any way accurate...
