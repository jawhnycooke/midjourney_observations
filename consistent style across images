RELEVANT BACKGROUND:

    User can specify up to 10 images as references
    User can specify up to 4000 characters of text descriptions
    User can modify the following parameters: (1) chaos, (2) version, (3) style, (4) seed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORE QUESTION: What is the most effective way to ensure a consistent style across images from multiple prompts?

    This discussion explores how a user can prompt Midjourney to create a series of images all within the same
    consistent, custom, AI-style; it is not concerned with pre-existing art styles that can easily be specified by
    including "in photorealistic style..." terms in the text.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERSTANDING THE MODEL DYNAMICS:

Midjourney, Dall-e-2, etc. all use a series of image-text pairs, mostly derived from the LAION datasets. When you specify
a prompt for the model, it will go back through all of its image-text pair references and favor those images that contain
your specific keywords. 

The image reference feature works by providing heavier weighting to the specific images referenced, in combination with
your supplied text references. The model then aggregates features identified from your image references with features
found in the images associated with your text prompt to create a final composite image meeting your request. 

NOTE: you can control how much emphasis is given to your reference images vs. the text prompt using the --iw parameter.

IMPLICATIONS:

About the image weighting parameter...

    There are hundreds of millions of image-text pairs in the LAION datasets, with hundreds of thousands to millions
    potentially matching your prompt. In contrast, you can only specify 10 reference images. As such, even when using
    a very small --iw, your reference images will significantly outweight any individual image matching the text
    prompt.
